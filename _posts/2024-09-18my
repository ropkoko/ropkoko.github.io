#My First Blog

Actually I'm very exited to be able to write my first blog ever since i started my software engineering, I have been hearing of blog but i never had any idea of how i could start wring my own blog. I had to find ways of how to write a blog, so i went to a tutorial in youtube by Ahamed tremo, and honestly I'm so impressed that i have managed to build my blog. I cannot say the journey was easy since i had no clue of how to create this blog. But finally i have made it and I'm supper proud of myself to many engineers it might seem easy like it does to me now, but priorly  its seemed hard and impossible all thanks to my uncle collins, who told me how essential a blog is to my career.

I have now created this blog and i will keep on updating it always,I'm currently a student at alx bootcamp and trust you me, i'm doing great now. i can now code and debug my projects with not much difficultie like before, all thanks to my peer and mentors at alx. Many things can be said but lemme cut it short and be ready to update this blog with my progress.
