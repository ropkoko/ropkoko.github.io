#Hello World

This is my first blog i create on september 18 2024 since i had no idea how to create a blog as a software engineer, i had to find tutorials on how to build a blog and i found one by Amhed Tremo and was a very nice tutosial, which has eneabled me to build this blog, I have become more happy on the progress I'm making each and everyday in the firel of software engineering and i get motivated when i achieve something everyday and this has kept me yearning to do more of web development 

I learn in alx bootcamp and each day i learn how to face challanges nd deal with them appropriately, I ensure that i get to learn something and practice it before the end of the day, this experience in alx has also eneable me to write and debug codes, at first it was had to debug and find solution to the codes that i was dealing with, but now i can say i enjoy doing every bit of coding and debugging

My progress is quit good and i can really say i have done something great so far but I'm still going to do more. Currently I'm looking foward to  doing portfolio project with alx and i'm eagerly waiting to colaborate with my peers and also to learn more things from there, i bet it will be a nice experience that I'm looking forward to.
